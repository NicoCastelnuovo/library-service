# library-service

The App is a simulation of a Library service, in which the logged user can access either to the status of its own book status and perform related actions, nor to the admin's actions in the case he has the right permissions. To mock the backend, I used the json-server package.

The project is not finished yet. The future main implementation are:
- Make the state persistent.
- Admin's actions: explore the registered users, modify the role of other users, add new books, edit existing books, look at the booking history.
- Fetch data from a GPS service which displays the nearest bibliothek to the logged user.
